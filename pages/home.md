## What Is

Ancient artifacts = laser guns, holograms, screens, keycards, hydroelectric generators, terraforming walls, water purifiers, batteries. 

No one understands how to create these things. 

Electricity is not understood. Elders provide some maintenance knowledge, but it's ritualistic and often incorrect. 

Only a few believe/know the semi correct stories about what happened.

Since most who fled to here were criminals, protesters, and paranoid libertarians, the culture of their descendants tends toward isolation and anarchy.

Another "alien" civ on the other side of the planet mostly keep to their continent, but some immigrate. This is where knowledge of magic (mostly witchy magic) is kept secret from the offworlders.

Automatons continue their endless tasks.

## What Was

Over 200 years ago, two Empires formed a treaty agreeing that neither would interfere with this contested planet, that it would simply be ignored.

Criminals, anarchists, religious extremists, and other desperate folk fled to it as a safe haven, but they had no way of maintaining or building tech, mostly due to lack of expertise. Constant upheaval of government, gang warfare, and philosophical movements against various kinds of knowledge removed what little stability remained. 

## Capital (Megadungeon)

Most tech is in the Capital, a dense, piecemeal hub that was a port city on the center edge of the larger continent (there are only two) for space trade. 

From a distance, it's a giant block made of 5 individual highrises occasionally connected by makeshift bridges.

Sealed floors, broken elevators, collapsed stairwells, and connections between one highrise and the next.

Navigating it occasionally requires parkour, bridge-building, climbing, or the use of a zip line. 

It's not a city anymore. It's a claustrophobic, half-vertical wilderness with occasional settled spaces. (It's a point-crawl dungeon.) 

Traps originally existed to protect property /gang territory etc. Some are still for that purpose and some are recently-built, but many are ancient and technologically advanced.

Mysterious, untainted tech is rumored to be on the highest floors, guarded by traditional tribes and hermits.

Other wonders are rumored to be lost in the high rises: archives, cultural texts, and manuals. 

Many locations, even in A, are completely blocked (often by dangerous defenses) and require a key to access. 

Ancient writings often have words similar to modern writings and usually use the same alphabet. Most books are from Empire 1. Empire 2 books use a different alphabet. 

Each tower is large enough to house a city state or two, but they're mostly abandoned. The top floor much more competently connects all highrises to each other and houses a strange civilization of isolationist engineers who understand most of the city's technology and guard it closely, including a huge library of ordinary books, but especially manuals

### Rumored Treasures

1. Terraforming machines

![Kowloon-capital-TOP](images/uploads/Kowloon-capital-TOP.png)

![Kowloon-capital](images/uploads/Kowloon-capital.png)

The bottom floor of each building has automated defenses. The one at A is deactivated or destroyed.

The towers are made of dense concrete. They could be hacked through.

A is easily reached from the city. Walking to the outside of E is more dangerous than traveling through the other highrises, if you have keys to move through them and know how to do so.

Maybe there is something great past E, outdoors? Create rumors and an actual thing.

### A

Just north of Access. Many know important details, but much information is guarded closely because those who have been there have a vested interest in exploring faster and further than anyone else, lest their prize be taken or destroyed by someone else. It will be hard to gather more than rumors. Gathering intel about deeper areas is difficult. 

The buildings here are generally under 10 stories tall. Unsealed buildings house bandits and monsters. 

## Encounters

1. gang
   undisciplined, patrols the area, attempting to kill anyone they consider "a threat to the expedience of our Lord's extraction of the material." They sound like a cult, but they're paid in drugs (which make them stupid and temperamental) to guard the area against anyone who doesn't benefit their boss. 1d12 members present. 1 HD. 3 HP. 
2. 1 bear. 
3. Drone
   attempts to stay out of reach but watches party. Allows a rival party to ambush if it's not evaded or destroyed in d4+3 turns.
4. Rival party. (See *Rival Parties*.)
5. Bandits
   who ambush and loot other explorers, killing them if afraid to let them live or if they're uncooperative
6. Aristocrat party
7. Tainted explorer
8. Obsessed Tinkerer
   with tools and stashed keys
9. Cult
   Totally devoted suppliers of the elder families at the top of the towers. They bring gardening stuff, ugly enslaved women (less likely to be discontent), and raw materials.
10. Cyborgs
    work to connect the ai to everything. They're corpses with lots of cybernetics keeping them alive. "Killed" ones are collected by crabots and transported to nearest surgical cube for repair. 
11. Children of the Capital
    Thin, gangly people who always look about 20-40 years older than they are. Surgically granted specialized knowledge about one kind of tech, as an adolescent rite of passage. The knowledge is subconscious, but most will, eventually, at least once in their lifetime, be taken by a fit of isolationism and craft a marvelous artifact. No one knows the artifact is dependent on the rite, which is only a superstitious tradition.
12. Traders consist of 3-18 level 1 fighters, with 1-4 mules, engaged primarily in excavation and recovery of artifacts - they'll be armed, and will also have shovels, picks, and digging equipment.  Like everyone else, they've arrived in Trade Town via longship and will be dressed appropriately.
13. Veterans
    A group of veterans is a mix of 2-12 fighters of levels 1-3, per the BX rules.  Unlike traders, these Vikings explore the ruins seeking monster lairs and creatures to fight and loot.
14. Wight/Wraith/Specter

## Capital Access City

Trade city. Economy built on trade of items and information from the Capital and services for those who wish to explore/scavenge it. Many factions and individual patrons due to "gold rush" competitiveness/excitement/greed. 

Limited resources and at high cost.

No access to magical items or services. 

Local merchants usually pay 60% of value for goods they're interested in and then export for resale. 

Local faction provides access to dungeon entrance and passage back out as a paid service. Also guards passage to city. 

Secret wizard, witch. 

### Government

Called upon for mediation of disagreement. Little else. 

### Laws

- Anyone may scavenge/explore
- personal disagreements/feuds handled by meditation, duel, or trial (last resort though only official method.) 
- harm to locals by outsiders meets harshest punishment

## Governments

- Rule by Lottery. rulership assigned by lottery on randomly assigned dates unknown to all except the lottery-council. The current ruler may choose a single assassin to remove their successor within the first two weeks to regain power. Clerical Conspiracies. 
- Pure plutocracy.  $1 = 1 vote.  No need for taxes?  Governmental positions can be bought and sold as commodities?  Speculative market for governerships?
- Elderocracy.  You get a number of votes equal to your age.  Bonus points if there are a few elves around. 
- Exilocracies are awesome.  Rulership by a deposed monarch/anti-pope.
  Necrocracy.  Rulership by the dead. Either living representatives of established families who speak for the dead, or actual conjured spirits.
- Rulership by the strong.  Can be (a) whoever is best at chess, (c) best at having the strongest champion, (d) best at having a sports team.
- Goodocracy.  Rulership by the goodest.  Basically the pope throws out merits.  Like "50 points to Gryffindor" and equally bullshit, EXCEPT over time a codified system of precedent emerges.  Like, you get 1 point for every invading orc you kill, no discussion.  Probably involves fuzziness and pope-kissing, BUT it might also include fun things like politicians/dukes making a big show of saving orphans, not having dinner with women who aren't their wife, shedding a tear whenever they see a dove, etc.
- Kleptocracy.  Rulership by whoever physically possesses the crown, without violence. Anyone who steals it by way of violence is the king, but the death penalty for murderous crown theft is the highest law of the land.
- Protagonocracy. A council of writers decides who would be most dramatically appropriate to rule.
- Ascetocracy: temporal power awarded based on ability to deny oneself temporal pleasures, self-denial. Mass fasts instead of debates. Every crown is made of worse thorns. Longest in deprivation chamber is king.
- Narcocracy: leader has everyone else addicted to drug only they can supply

- medical machine that injects anything passing through a door with an immunization medicine that causes severe nausea.
- steam vents
- Motion sensing doors that greet people loudly, alerting anyone in earshot.
- A giant burning tire heap. the city threatens to remove the tire heap as it's a blight on the city but armed residents fight back as they use the tires for fuel during the winter.

### Monsters!

Butterfly Migration - Sapphire lords, a butterfly with a 2’ wingspan, rich vibrancy and long feathery antenna travel in locust like swarms.  They are defenseless to the birds that trail after them nibbling at the edges of the swarm.  THe birds dare not eat too many as the butterflys are deadly poisonous, even to a larger creature if eaten in bulk (a meal’s worth requires a Save v. Poison).

Creature that smell like liquor. Causes drunkenness when eaten.

Owlbears (2D6) - Usually arcanovore scavengers, the jay feathered ‘growlyhoots’ of the Midnight jungle have grown more predatory in an environment where all life is infused with magic.  They are lean pack hunters, tracking, circling, and distracting their prey with quizzical hooting and then rushing in from the rear to drag it down beaks snapping.

Blue Monks (2D6) - blue monks roam from the city on a mission from their “god”, they are unlikely to talk but also unlikely to attack, preferring to return immediately to the city a inform their fellows before organizing a hunt for trespassers to sacrifice.

Slave laborers digging, mining, breaking walls,building stairs.
