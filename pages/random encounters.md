Still these four elements (Type/Strength), Intelligence, Number and Special Abilities can mechanically define pretty much all monsters.  Below I have created a set of tables for generating the mechanical elements of a random encounter table. One can roll a smaller die for generally less powerful monsters, and roll separately in each column (Though I'd suggest adding 1 point to the 'Number' roll  for every class of monster stronger then Very Weak, i.e. 1D12+4 for Very Strong monsters). I'd also limit the 'Special Ability' rolls to no more then 1/2 the monsters in a random table, especially for lower level areas.

|      | Type      | Intelligence | Number         | Special Abilities                            |
| ---- | --------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | V. Weak   | None         | Swarm (6D6)    | Poison (Save or Die)                         |
| 2    | V. Weak   | Intelligent  | Mob (4D6)      | Stealth (Surprise on 1-4/backstab)           |
| 3    | V. Weak   | Animal       | Gang (3D6)     | Strong Attack (double damage)                |
| 4    | Weak      | Intelligent  | Gang (3D6)     | Multi Attack (Additional Attacks)            |
| 5    | Weak      | Animal       | Family (1D6/2) | Stunning (Save v. Paralysis)                 |
| 6    | Weak      | Animal       | Pack (1D6)     | Entangling (Auto hit after first)            |
| 7    | Normal    | Animal       | Pack (1D6)     | Immunity (Weapons or spells)                 |
| 8    | Normal    | Intelligent  | Pair (1D6/3)   | Damage Absorption (-X damage per hit/rnd)    |
| 9    | Normal    | Intelligent  | Family (1D6/2) | Regeneration (Recovers HP per/rnd)           |
| 10   | Strong    | None         | Pair (1D6/3)   | Death Ray/Touch (Save v. Paralysis or death) |
| 11   | Strong    | Intelligent  | Solo           | Spellcaster (Spell power based on Type)      |
| 12   | V. Strong | Animal       | Solo           | Breath Attack (Dam = HP to all in area)      |

How does this work?  Let's say I'm generating a new area - so I roll up six monster types using the above table and get the following (I used a 6 in 12 chance of monsters having a special ability, with 3 abilities max for the table).

| D6   | Random, Random Encounter Table        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Weak, Intelligent, Pack, Regeneration |
| 2    | Normal, Animal, Family, None          |
| 3    | V. Weak, Animal, Pair,  Death Ray     |
| 4    | V. Weak, Animal, Gang, Stunning       |
| 5    | V. Weak,  None, Swarm - None          |
| 6    | Weak, Intelligent, Pair - None        |

So here we have (based on as close an approximation as I can think of using standard monsters): Goblins (regenerating ones), Wolves, Spitting Cobras, Fire Beetles, Rat Swarm, Kobalds.  Without discussing how uninspiring this monster list is for a GM, it is also an eclectic mess at worst and at best tells the player nothing about the location they are exploring.  The monsters are also likely well known "It's a spitting cobra, I cover my eyes and we throw oil bombs" and their tricks and dangers surmounted by rote memorization of the Monster Manual or other popular fantasy sources rather then through thinking about the description provided by the GM.  

Once one accepts that monsters themselves aren't mechanically especially different (one may still adjust a stat line here and there), but instead falling into broad classes it becomes far easier to use them organically or naturalistically.  Freed from the tyranny of a Monster Manual, where one has a selection of nearly identical humanoids or beasts of the 'Weak' type (goblins etc) that need to be slotted into a location based on what might fit the best, one can take the stat-line of a 'goblin', maybe adding a few touches for flair, and build a unique creature over the mechanical frame.  Such a random encounter list, which might seemed eclectic and thrown together can work to support the feeling of the adventure and location (and might even inspire rooms and challenges - for example I now know there's going to be creepy rodent shrines and rooms of rat sized crypts built into the walls of the location described below).

Now, lets say I think about the area with the above random encounter table and decide it's an ancient crumbling mansion, the equivalent of a Lvl 2 dungeon.  The old place has been cursed by the 'Lues Rex' - the rat deity of disease, poverty and riot as a temple for his cult and locus of his intrusion into the world.  The monsters within are thus going to be manifestations and servants of this rat god, allowing me to take the mechanics above and create a flavorsome list of monsters.

| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | Ratkin (1d6) - Twisted by magical disease, these shaggy lumpen figures with the faces of snarling rats were once men, but their terrible devotion has transformed them.  They attack wearing ragged hides and wielding rusting weapons.  The sorcery that has warped them makes them very hard to kill.

| 2    | Dire Rats (1D6/2) - Huge filthy Rats the size of a large dog.  They stalk and leap having grown fat and canny on the flesh of their smaller kin and the occasional intruder.  HD 2, AC 6, ATK 1 (bite), ML 8, SV F2 |
| 3    | Rat King (1D6/3) - A tangle of cannibal rodents, living, dead and undead, twined by thier tails.  These horrors are blessed harbringers of the Lues Rex, the Great Rat King, and share his power and ability to curse and spread death, but their wretched protean forms are quite fragile and they are animated only by simple verminous minds.HD 1-1, AC 8, ATK 1* (Gaze of Filth), ML 10, SV F 0 * The fixed gaze of the rat king produces disease and corruption at an incredible rate.  Each round it may gaze upon a target who must save v. poison or collapse dying and bursting with unnatural diseases. |
| 4    | Rodent Revenants (3D6) - Ghostly scuttling rodents, rags of skin and bone, once the great grey eminences of their packs and clans they still serve the Lues Rex, hunting and scuttling among detritus to paralyze the enemies of rodent kind with their arcane bite, leaving them as meat for their multitude of progeny. HD 1-1, AC 8, ATK 1* (Paralyzing Bite), ML 10, SV F 0* The bite of these undead rats causes a terrible itching and fever, requiring a save vs. paralysis to resist.  Those who fail to save fall to the floor scratching them selves and delusional for 1D6 turns as the fever burns out. |
| 5    | Frenzied Rats (swarm) - A mass of swarming biting rats driven into driven to divine ecstasy to seethe through walls, burst from drains or holes and devour all living things.HD 1/2 (HP 36), AC 8, ATK 2*, ML 12, SV F0   * The Swarm may engulf up to two targets in melee, after an initial hit the swarm will continue to do damage each round until it is destroyed or the target is engulfed in flame or submerged in liquid. |
| 6    | Cult Scions (1D6/3) - Men and women with the same sharp cast to their features, the incestuous and mad scions of the Manse, they now serve the rats within catering to their needs and performing the minor interactions with the outside world required by their rodent masters.  They wear concealed armor beneath musty and antiquated clothes and fight with thrown knives and their sharp filed teeth.HD 1*, AC 6, ATK 1 (bite/thrown weapon), ML 8, SV F1 |
